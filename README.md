# Simple Neural Network from Scratch (NumPy)

This project is a minimal implementation of a feedforward neural network using NumPy. It includes:
- Dense layers
- Forward and backward propagation
- ReLU, Tanh, Softmax (activation functions)
- Cross-entropy loss
- Batch training
- Optimizers: SGD and Adam
